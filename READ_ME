The initial login window presented requires a random 8 character long username, as well as the password. However the password must contain a '.' or '&' symbol.
The way the database is accessed is by using an SQL connector with my own username and password. 
Change those to the values of your database URLs and you should be able to connect.
The SQL database file is included and can be copied and pasted to create your own identical database.
